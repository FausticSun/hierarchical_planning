2025-09-25 16:27:29,405 [INFO] Mission statement: Recon satellites have detected 10 enemy signal jammers deployed across the battlespace. These jammers interfere with UAV navigation and must be disabled.
Analysts believe the devices were placed using a coded grid pattern to confuse interception teams.
Your 5-drone squadron must split up, interpret the mission hints, and neutralize all jammers.

Intercepted briefing:
 * No jammer lies within 20 cells of the boundary.
 * Two jammers sit exactly on the perimeter of the square (150,150)–(350,350).
 * Three jammers are within 10–30 Manhattan steps of the radar post at (400,100).
 * Two jammers are hidden northeast of (120,120) but also within 40 steps.
 * Three jammers are mirror-placed across the vertical line x=250, all within 15 steps of y=400.

Time is critical. Coordinate your drones to cover the grid efficiently and disable all jammers before they can disrupt our operations.
