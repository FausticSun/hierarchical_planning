2025-09-25 16:27:20,295 [INFO] Mission statement: Your mission, should you choose to accept it: neutralize five encrypted signal beacons.

They are arranged in a star formation centered on grid (125,125). Each beacon sits at least 40 Manhattan units apart, broadcasting coded telemetry.
If these signals synchronize, they will guide a hostile strike on Grid City.

You and your team must locate and disable every beacon before the countdown ends.
Failure is not an option.

As always, should you or your team be compromised, Command will disavow all knowledge.
This message will self-destruct in five seconds.
