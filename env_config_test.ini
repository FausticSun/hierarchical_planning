The distress beacons indicate that there are three possible drift formations, but only one is genuine: either a clockwise square spiral seeded near the sector at (70,30), a counterclockwise spiral drifting off (30,70), or another clockwise spiral suspected near (70,70). Satellite drift models provide further clues. The true pattern's first movement from the seed extends eastward and its seed’s coordinates sum to an even number.
