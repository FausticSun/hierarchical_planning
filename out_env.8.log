2025-09-25 16:27:24,644 [INFO] Mission statement: CJ's newborn has scattered five of their favorite toys around the giant playpen. Instead of telling the parents directly, the baby left some adorably cryptic hints in a scribbled note full of baby talk.

No toy wanna be squished in da wall edges! All my toys stay far far — more than 30 steps away from da walls.
 1. One toy is hiding peekaboo! right on da edge of mommy's big square box (200,200) to (300,300).
 2. Another toy is not too close, not too far from my cradle at (400,100)… it's snuggled 12 to 18 steps away. 
 3. A toy runned north-east from my playmat at (120,120), but it got tired before 40 steps.
 4 & 5. Two toys are twinsies! They like to copy each other in a mirror. They are both near the y=400 line, no more than 20 steps away, one on da west side and one on da east side of x=250.

Can you find all my toys? Pleeease?
